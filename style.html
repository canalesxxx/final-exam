                    The first part of the process is to saut√© beef with garlic and onion. Start by heating oil in wide pot. Cook the garlic, onion, and beef. Continue to saute the beef until the color browns a bit. Add bay leaves and crushed peppercorn. Continue by adding liver spread, tomato sauce, and beef broth.

                <p>
                    Adobo is prepared using pantry basics, like white vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaves, to create a marinade. The meat is marinated in this mixture overnight, then simmered in the same marinade on the stove top until the meat is cooked through.
